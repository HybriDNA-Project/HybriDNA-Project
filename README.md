# HybriDNA: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba2 Long-Range DNA Language Model

HybriDNA is a breakthrough language model that revolutionizes DNA sequence analysis and design by combining Transformer and Mamba2 architectures. This repository contains the project website and associated resources.

## Overview

HybriDNA is designed to process ultra-long DNA sequences at single-nucleotide resolution, offering:

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines Transformer and Mamba2 for optimal performance
- **Long-Range Processing**: Handles sequences up to 131,072 nucleotides
- **Multi-Species Support**: Pretrained on 800+ species genomes
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Excels in 33+ genomic understanding tasks
- **Efficient Computation**: 3.4Ã— higher training throughput vs. standard Transformers

## Project Website

The project website showcases HybriDNA's capabilities and results across various genomic tasks:

- Causal eQTL Variant Effect Prediction
- Transcription Factor Binding Prediction
- Chromatin Accessibility Prediction
- Human Enhancer Generation
